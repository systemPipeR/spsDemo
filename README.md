This is the repository for our Shiny Contest submission.

## What is systemPipeShiny 
_systemPipeShiny_ (SPS) is a Shiny application for interactive data analysis workflow 
management and a framework for downstream data visualization. SPS allows non-R users, 
such as experimentalists, to design, control, execute and visualize data analysis 
workflows interactively without requiring knowledge of R. Moreover, SPS has 
been designed as a general purpose framework to allow users perform deep customization 
and add their own components.
